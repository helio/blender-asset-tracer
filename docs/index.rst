Welcome to Blender Asset Tracer's documentation!
================================================

Blender Asset Tracer, a.k.a. BATðŸ¦‡, is the replacement of BAM_ and
blender-file_. BATðŸ¦‡ can be used to list all dependencies of a blend file, such
as linked blend files, textures, Alembic files, and caches. Furthermore, it can
be used to create a BAT Pack (see :ref:`packing`), which contains the blend file
and its dependencies.
